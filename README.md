## Guide 🛠️

### 1. Setting Up Moralis API
To get started, you'll need to add your Moralis API key in `saldoKripto.js`. 
- You can get a free API key from [here](https://admin.moralis.io/register) (but beware of those pesky rate limits! 😆).

### 2. Adding OpenAI API
Next, add your ChatGPT API key in `generateRoast.js` to generate those spicy roasts.
- If you want to go free, just switch the model to Gemini instead of using the premium one.

### 3. Running the Project
Once you've added the Moralis and OpenAI API keys, you can fire up the project by running:

```bash
node server.js
